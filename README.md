# IPL_first_innigs_score_prediction

This is a **Machine Learning Web App** development repository. 

The data was acquired from kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020
It consists of two tables.

Initial data cleaning and joining the two tables was done in **SQL** and final data was exported as csv.

Regression models were built in **Python** using **sklearn** with **hyperparameter tuning**.

Finally, the model was deployed using **Flask** to create a web app.
