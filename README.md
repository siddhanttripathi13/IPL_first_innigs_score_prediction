# IPL_first_innigs_score_prediction

This is a **_Machine Learning Web App_** development repository. 

The data was acquired from kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/patrickb1912/ipl-complete-dataset-20082020

It consists of two tables.

Initial data cleaning and joining the two tables was done in **_SQL_** and final data was exported as csv.

Regression models were built in **_Python_** using **_sklearn_** with **_hyperparameter tuning_**.

Finally, the model was deployed using **_Flask_** to create a web app.
